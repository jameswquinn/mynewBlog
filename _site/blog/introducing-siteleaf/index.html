      <p><strong>Approach</strong> — Managing content on sites can be a precarious task. We wanted to build a lean tool that would integrate easily into your workflow, yet provide everything necessary to maintain your content.</p>

<p><strong>Goals</strong> — Siteleaf aims to strike a balance between control and simplicity. We believe content management systems should be simple but not overly simplified. That you own your content, your sites should be able to outlive their CMS, and you should be able to host sites anywhere you want. With these principles in mind we developed Siteleaf.</p>

<p><strong>Features</strong> — Siteleaf is a lightweight platform for publishing websites. Write with markdown, collaborate with colleagues, develop with templates, build with <a href="https://github.com/siteleaf">our API</a>.</p>

<p><em>If you can write HTML, you can create with Siteleaf.</em></p>

<p>Develop locally with our built-in support for <a href="http://anvilformac.com">Anvil</a> and <a href="http://pow.cx">Pow</a>. You’re fully in control of your content. With Siteleaf you can publish to your FTP, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files/">Rackspace Cloud Files</a>, or our Siteleaf Hosting and your content lives on forever. Sign up at our early adopter price and lock in free Siteleaf Hosting.</p>

<p><strong>Outro</strong> — Building Siteleaf has been a rewarding exercise in creating a web product from the ground up. We embraced the constraints of a time-boxed, iterative approach and worked within our limits to create our dream CMS. We are excited and proud to announce that as of today the first version of the new Siteleaf has launched and is ready to get to work! We think Siteleaf can change the way you manage sites. We love it and we think you will too. Choose from our <a href="http://siteleaf.com/plans">three plans</a> and take advantage of our <strong>14-day trial period</strong>.</p>
