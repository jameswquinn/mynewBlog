Jessica Harllee, Siteleaf Hackday MVP and all around cool person, was nice enough to write about how she used Siteleaf to rebuild Erin Nolan’s personal site. Some great takeaways from her post include how she used Siteleaf metadata fields on posts and assets to achieve a unique color palette for each page and to control how images were displayed throughout the layout. On the blog, some posts are more text-heavy whereas sometimes Erin wants a glorious image header. To make it flexible, we look for an asset with the [meta field] type of hero and display that image above the post excerpt. If there’s no hero image, then the post text displays as normal.

      <p>We always love hearing the experiences of others who have built their site with Siteleaf. <a href="http://jessicaharllee.com/">Jessica Harllee</a>, Siteleaf Hackday MVP and all around cool person, was nice enough to write about how she used Siteleaf to rebuild <a href="http://www.madebyeno.com/">Erin Nolan’s personal site</a>. Some great takeaways from her post include how she used Siteleaf <a href="http://www.siteleaf.com/blog/metadata-in-siteleaf/">metadata</a> fields on posts and assets to achieve a unique color palette for each page and to control how images were displayed throughout the layout.</p>

  <p>On the blog, some posts are more text-heavy whereas sometimes Erin wants a glorious image header. To make it flexible, we look for an asset with the [meta field] <code class="highlighter-rouge">type</code> of <code class="highlighter-rouge">hero</code> and display that image above the post excerpt. If there’s no hero image, then the post text displays as normal.</p>
